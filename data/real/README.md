# Real X-ray Observatory Data

## Purpose
Demonstrate pipeline capability on authentic astronomical observations.

## Data Sources
- **Chandra**: High-resolution X-ray imaging
- **XMM-Newton**: Large effective area observations
- **Selection criteria**: Well-studied sources, compact field size

## Limitations
- Pipeline not optimized for mission-specific calibrations
- Results are qualitative demonstrations, not scientific analyses
- Instrument response functions not included

## Processing Notes
Real data processing shows:
1. FITS file parsing capability
2. Basic source detection algorithms
3. Coordinate transformation accuracy
4. Web interface functionality with authentic data
